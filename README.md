# Skillserver

This repository includes the so-called 'Skillserver' of the G.E.C.K.O. project.  
It provides skill and information about them.  
You do not need to run this.  
Instances of the [Skillmanager]() connect to a public instance by default.  
To learn how you can use the complete skillsystem, you should take a look at our [project website](https://gecko-voice-assistant.github.io/gecko/).

## Bugs

## Licence
